# Architecture Components
Implementation of Android's Architecture Components with Dagger 2, Room, LiveData, MVVM, and Retrofit.

Simple app that uses Stack Exchange's public Stack Overflow API to fetch users with Retrofit and OkHttp, inserts them into the app's DB with Room, displays the users as a list with LiveData, dependency injection with Dagger 2, and follows the MVVM architecture pattern.
