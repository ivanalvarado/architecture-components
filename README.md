# Architecture Components
Implementation of Android's Architecture Components with Dagger 2, Room, LiveData, MVVM, and Retrofit.

Simple app that uses Stack Exchange's public Stack Overflow API to fetch users with Retrofit and OkHttp, inserts them into the app's DB with Room, displays the users as a list with LiveData, dependency inject with Dagger 2, and follows MVVM architecture pattern.
